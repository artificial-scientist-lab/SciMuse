## Concept Extraction
1. Initial Concept Extraction:
We analyzed the titles and abstracts of approximately 2.44 million papers from four preprint datasets using the RAKE algorithm, enhanced with additional stopwords, to extract potential concept candidates.
- Initial filtering retained two-word concepts appearing in at least nine articles.
- Concepts with more than three words were retained if they appeared in six or more articles. 

2. Quality Improvement: To enhance the quality of identified concepts, we implemented a suite of automated tools to address domain-independent errors commonly associated with RAKE. We then manually reviewed and removed inaccuracies such as non-conceptual phrases, verbs, and conjunctions. For further details, refer to the [Impact4Cast Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08640) and our [GitHub code for concept extraction](https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/Impact4Cast/tree/main/create_concepts).

3. Further Refinement with GPT:
We used GPT-3.5 to refine the concepts further, which resulted in the removal of 286,311 entries. Using Wikipedia, we restored 40,614 mistakenly removed entries, resulting in a final, refined list of 123,128 concepts. For details on prompt engineering, refer to the appendix of the [SciMuse paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17044).
